# Open Programming Degree 

## Mission Statement
I want to create a free and open way for people to learn programming from the fundamentals up.

Too many times I've seen people struggle with the simple elements of programming while being expected to do something complex (build a compiler).
Another issue I've seen is people being taught libraries or apis when they wanted to learn how to program. React is an amazing tool and project but it's not really "learning javascript" it's more like learning a specialized DSL. 

My aim is to fix this gap between programming for beginners to programming for more advanced beginners.

On top of this, my aim is to keep the entire process free and open source and available so anyone may make suggestions, additions, or fork the whole project and make their own version. 

## Languages Used In This Course
The high-level language this course will use is TypeScript. Why TypeScript?   
1. Functional and OOP or even just procedural programming.
2. Batteries included for most things.
3. Stable and mature ecosystem.
4. Support for UI programming.
5. Garbage collection.
6. Javascript is everywhere.

The low-level language this course will use is Rust. Why Rust? (Warning! Opinions)
1. More clean implementation of memory management than C.
2. More strict type system.
3. Better tools to understand lower level systems, cleaner code.
4. Some semblance of OOP and functional paradigms.
5. Some simple collections that we don't want to implement like Maps and Vectors.
6. More complex and strict than C, but for the better. Not easy to make many mistakes with memory management and indexing.

Both:
1. Similar syntax. 
2. NPM and Cargo are both easy to use to get libraries or make your own.
3. No complicated setup like makefiles or linking. (At least until you start hitting domains.)

## Other Languages
Some other languages/DSLs we will use:
1. SQL students will have to learn how to use a database to be able to code most apps.
2. JSON this is the standard for config files.
3. Markdown so they can document their code and ideas more easily.
4. Some console commands, Git, Cargo, Node, Tsc, etc.
