# Open Programming Degree 

## Mission Statement
I want to create a free and open way for people to learn programming from the fundamentals up.

Too many times I've seen people struggle with the simple elements of programming while being expected to do something complex (build a compiler).

My aim is to fix this gap between programming for beginners to programming for more advanced beginners.

On top of this, my aim is to keep the entire process free and open source and available so anyone may make suggestions, additions, or fork the whole project and make their own version. 

## Languages Used In This Course
The language I will be using for this course is TypeScript. Why TypeScript?   
1. Functional and OOP or even just procedural programming.
2. Batteries included for most things.
3. Stable and mature ecosystem.
4. Support for UI programming.
5. High Level.

The other language this course will use is C to explain lower level concepts and memory management, but it will be explored at the end of the course. 

## High Level Concepts

1. Operators
